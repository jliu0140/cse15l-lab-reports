Click on your account name and look for a prompt to change your password. When creating a password, make sure it includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. Some characters such as spaces will not be allowed. When you have your password, make sure to mark no for "Change my TritonLink password. After, stay in the confirm password box and press enter. Do not click "Check Password."
