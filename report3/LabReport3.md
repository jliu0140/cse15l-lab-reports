## Find
The find command will find all the files and directories within the given directory. For example, using `find written_2/' will print all of the files and directories inside the written_2 directory.

Some additional options that we can use for the find command include `-name`, `-delete`, `-maxdepth`, and `-mindepth`.

## -Name
The `-name` option will look for files within the directory that has the given name in its file name. It can be used by adding `-name name` after the directory.
